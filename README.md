# HealthLedger

HealthLedger is a hyperledger fabric and IPFS based elecetronic health record storing and sharing system. ExpressJS is used here to create a Decentralized Application which stores health data and stores in the IPFS network. The QmHASH of the IPFS then is stored in a transaction in the fabric newtwork. The owner can only give access to the person who can view the data. This ensures that the stewardship of the data remains in the hands of the data owner.
